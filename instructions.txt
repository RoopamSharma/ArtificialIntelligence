Its an implementation of Uniform Cost Search that uses BFS as base for searching and the fringe is implemented using the queue data structure.

To run the algorithm:
findroute.py input_file source destination
input_file: file name for input paths represented as source destination and their respective costs. All the paths are two ways.
source: origin city name
destination: destination city name
